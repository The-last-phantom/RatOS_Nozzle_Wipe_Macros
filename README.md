# RatOS_Nozzle_Wipe_Macros
Automated nozzle scrubbing macros for RatOS-based 3D printers, including IDEX and non-IDEX setups. Fully modular and configurable, START_PRINT-compatible, and designed for reliable pre-print nozzle cleaning.

These macros were initially written to utilise the V-Core 4 front arm nozzle wipers the way we all expected they would be utilised by RatOS. The modular nature of them makes them suitable for use on lots of machines though.
